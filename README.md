# Food Consensus

## Project Description
### (Food) Voting App
One user starts a motion, many users vote on motion, the final motion that gets voted on is the destination that they agree to go to.

### Pitch to businesses
We help users decide where to spend to their time. We believe this can benefit businesses because we can help redirect and focus our users to your business. In a way, this is a form of non-traditional advertising that can bring large tickets (groups of people) to your business.

## Technologies Used

* React - version 17.0.1
* Redux - version 4.0.5
* HTTP & CSS
