Notes:
- Do not invite yourself to a motion
- Everyone invited *_must_* vote before the final is made
- You can, but don't approve suggestions of the same name, they will show up as different votes on the client, but will be represented as the same vote on the backend

## (Food) Voting App
One user starts a motion, many users vote on motion, the final motion that gets voted on is the destination that they agree to go to.

### Pitch to businesses
We help users decide where to spend to their time. We believe this can benefit businesses because we can help redirect and focus our users to your business. In a way, this is a form of non-traditional advertising that can bring large tickets (groups of people) to your business.
